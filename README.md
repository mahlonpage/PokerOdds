# PokerOdds
This program generates random hands for two players in standard Texas Hold 'em style poker. It then computes the odds
of each player winning by generating every combination of community cards. It then calculates the best hand each player
can make and finds the winner. It then returns the odds of each player winning as well as the odds of a tie. 
Many poker engines use tables to simplify hands and calculate odds in a simpler fashion, but I wanted to brute force
each hand to find precise statistics.
